ðŸ‘‹ Hi, here's some of my interests in technology and software development, in no particular order:

- [JavaScript](https://tc39.es/) / [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) / [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Web as Platform](https://html-now.github.io/) / [Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- Tools and Builds
- Testing / QA

- Creativity

Read about some of my [recent projects](https://morganney.github.io/morganney/#projects) to see what else I've been working on, or check out [my public repositories](https://github.com/morganney?tab=repositories).
